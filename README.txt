Datasets:
    My car dataset is included as car.csv. 
    The red wine dataset can be found at this link: 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv'

Running my code:
    The code for each individual algorithm is in a separate python script. All you need to do is open a terminal instance, cd into whatever directory the files are in, and run 'python <file>.py', where file is one of 'boosting', 'decision_tree', 'knn', 'neuralnet', or 'svm'.
    Make sure that car.csv is in this directory.
    Running this command will run the cross validation, testing, and display the learning curves on the screen. The confusion matrix and accuracy score on the test data is printed to console. 
    The time in seconds it took to perform the cross-validation is also printed to console.
